In the last two months since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html">*The New York Times*</a> published an investigation about Harvey Weinstein's decades-long cover up of his sexual abuses against women in Hollywood, the U.S. has faced a reckoning. For the first time, women (and some men) in many industries have felt empowered to step forward and name the men who have harasseed them in the workplace. The problem isn't new, but our reactions to it are; for the first time, the public has placed the burden of proof on men, not women.  

As <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/rebecca-traister-on-the-post-weinstein-reckoning.html">Rebecca Traister says</a> of this reckoning, "It’s wild and not entirely fun...In the shock of the house lights having been suddenly brought up — of being forced to stare at the ugly scaffolding on which so much of our professional lives has been built — we’ve had scant chance to parse what exactly is inflaming us and who." There's a general sense of rage, but it's hard to know exactly where to direct it.
